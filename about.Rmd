# **About Me**
I am a undergraduate student and researcher at MSU, striving to use data and 
machine learning to make the world a better place. I'm intereseted in 
sustainable energy, space, environment and how a furture of AI and machine 
learning will help us to tackle these issues.

## Research
In my undergraduate research in the Ecosystem Dynamics Lab, I have focused on
environmental modeling and climate research. Lately, I've been working on a
project to model streamflow and how it is effected by climate change in the
Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.
